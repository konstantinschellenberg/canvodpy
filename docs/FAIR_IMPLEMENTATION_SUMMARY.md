# FAIR Compliance Setup - Implementation Summary

**Date:** April 7, 2026
**Repository:** nfb2021/canvodpy
**Status:** ✅ Complete — 5/5 green

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ✅ howfairis GitHub Action Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/fair-software.yml`

Automatically checks FAIR software compliance on every push and pull request:
- Runs the howfairis tool to verify the 5 FAIR recommendations
- Triggers on push to main/develop branches, PRs, and manual dispatch
- Provides colored output in workflow logs

**Badge Added to README:**
```markdown
[![FAIR Software](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy/actions/workflows/fair-software.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy/actions/workflows/fair-software.yml)
```

### 2. ✅ OpenSSF Scorecard Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`

Automated security best practices scanning:
- Runs weekly (Monday 1:30 UTC) and on push to main
- Checks 18+ security practices (dependency updates, code review, signed commits, etc.)
- Uploads results to GitHub Security tab (SARIF format)
- Publishes results to OpenSSF public API
- Enables the OpenSSF Scorecard badge

**Badge Added to README:**
```markdown
[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/nfb2021/canvodpy)
```

### 3. ✅ Security Policy
**File:** `SECURITY.md`

Comprehensive security documentation including:
- Supported versions policy
- Vulnerability reporting process (private GitHub advisories + email)
- Response timelines (48h initial, 7-90 days fix based on severity)
- Security best practices for users
- Known security considerations (file parsers, cloud storage, dependencies)
- Current security features and planned enhancements
- Coordinated vulnerability disclosure policy
- Security acknowledgments section

### 4. ✅ Updated howfairis Configuration
**File:** `.howfairis.yml`

Enhanced with:
- Clear explanations for why checks are skipped
- Comments documenting what checks already pass
- Links to relevant URLs

### 5. ✅ OpenSSF Best Practices Badge Guide
**File:** `docs/OPENSSF_BADGE_GUIDE.md`

Step-by-step guide for obtaining the OpenSSF badge:
- Overview of badge levels (Passing, Silver, Gold)
- Complete application process walkthrough
- Current compliance estimate (~70% already passing)
- Checklist of what's done vs. what's needed
- Quick wins for addressing remaining gaps
- Timeline and maintenance requirements

### 6. ✅ Updated README Badges

Added new "Security & FAIR" section with:
- FAIR Software workflow badge
- OpenSSF Scorecard badge

## Current FAIR Compliance Status

### ✅ All 5 FAIR Recommendations Met + OpenSSF Badge!

| # | Recommendation | Status | Evidence |
|---|----------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Repository** | ✅ Pass | Public GitHub repo with version control |
| 2 | **License** | ✅ Pass | Apache 2.0 in LICENSE file |

| 4 | **Citation** | ✅ Pass | CITATION.cff + Zenodo DOI (10.5281/zenodo.19445061) |
| 5 | **Checklist** | ✅ Pass | **OpenSSF Best Practices badge obtained!** ([Project 12329](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/12329)) |

**Overall:** 🟢 **5/5 complete**

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Already Working)
- ✅ Workflows will run automatically on next push
- ✅ Scorecard results will appear in Security tab after first run
- ✅ FAIR compliance is monitored on every PR

### Completed (Short Term)
- ✅ OpenSSF Best Practices badge obtained ([Project 12329](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/12329))
- ✅ GitHub Security Features enabled (secret scanning, private vulnerability reporting)
- ✅ REUSE 3.3 compliant (`uv run reuse lint` passes)

### Medium Term (Before v1.0.0)
1. **Consider Additional Security Enhancements**
   - Signed releases (GPG or Sigstore)
   - Release checksums (SHA256)
   - Supply chain security (SLSA provenance)

## Benefits Achieved

### For the Project
- ✅ Automated FAIR compliance monitoring
- ✅ Security best practices scanning
- ✅ Clear vulnerability reporting process
- ✅ Increased trust and credibility
- ✅ Better discoverability (OpenSSF public API)

### For Contributors
- ✅ Clear security guidelines
- ✅ Documented processes
- ✅ Automated checks catch issues early

### For Users

- Scorecard runs weekly
- Dependabot monitors dependencies

### Manual (Periodic)
- Review Scorecard findings monthly
- Update SECURITY.md if practices change
- Respond to vulnerability reports within 48h
